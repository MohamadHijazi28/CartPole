As part of the DQN agent you will need to implement a Q learning update rule, backprop through a neural network function approximator, an experience replay buffer, and a target network to which the network weights are periodically updated.

This is a simpler environment where the observation is not an image but rather a 4 dimensional vector defining the state, implementing a Deep Q-Network agent.
